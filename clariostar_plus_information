## absorbance measurements

### normal "discrete wavelength" measurements

wavelengths between 220 - 1000 nm

number of wavelengeght between 1 - 8

well_scan_types are: 
- point (fwp 1 - 200)
- orbital (fwp 1 - 44)
- spiral (fwp 1 - 127)
- matrix (fwp 1 - 200; matrix_size options: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8, 9x9, 10x10, 15x15, 20x20, 25x25, 30x30)


well_scan_width: between 1 - 6 mm, always int

settling time: between 0.0 - 1.0 s

number of cycles: between 1 - 1000

number of flashes: between 10 - 127

read direction: between 1 (top_left, bidirectional/"snake_line") - 16 (bottom_right, unidirectional/"always up")


shake options: before each cycle, before first cycle, before defined cycle, between readings

shake_types: linear, orbital, double orbital

shake_speed: 100 - 700 rpm (always in steps of 100)

shake_duration: sec

### spectral scan measurements

everything as above except:

wavelength has a start and end (min 220, max 1000 nm)
scan_step_size is either: 1, 2, 5, 10

spectral well_scan_types are: 
- point (fwp 1 - 200)
- orbital (fwp 1 - 44)
- spiral (fwp 1 - 127)
- but NOT matrix
