## absorbance measurements

### normal "discrete wavelength" measurements

wavelengths between 220 - 1000 nm

number of wavelengeght between 1 - 8

well_scan_types: point, orbital, spiral, matrix

well_scan_width: between 1 - 6 mm, always int

settling time: between 0.0 - 1.0 s

number of cycles: between 1 - 1000

number of flashes: between 10 - 127



read direction: between 1 (top_left, bidirectional/"snake_line") - 16 (bottom_right, unidirectional/"always up")


shake options: before each cycle, before first cycle, before defined cycle, between readings

shake_types: linear, orbital, double orbital

shake_speed: 100 - 700 rpm (always in steps of 100)

shake_duration: sec
