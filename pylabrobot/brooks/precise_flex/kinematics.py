"""
PF400 kinematics: FK and IK for a 4-DOF SCARA + prismatic Z + optional rail.

Joint dict keys match the firmware and `Axis` enum:
  1: J1 (Z lift) [mm]
  2: J2 (shoulder) [deg]
  3: J3 (elbow) [deg]
  4: J4 (wrist) [deg]
  6: rail position [mm] (optional; 0 if missing)

Task pose p = (x, y, z, yaw) with yaw in degrees. The gripper stays level
(all revolute axes parallel to world +Z), so IK is closed-form:
Z is decoupled, planar 2R for (x, y), wrist yaw for orientation.

Sign conventions follow right-hand rule about +Z (CCW positive looking down).
