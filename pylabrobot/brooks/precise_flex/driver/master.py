    Args:
      gripper_length: wrist-axis → TCP distance in mm. Used as the fallback /
        override; when ``read_kinematics_from_device`` is True (the default) the
        link lengths and tool length are read from the controller at setup and
        this value is only used if that read fails.
      gripper_z_offset: vertical offset in mm from the wrist plate to the tool tip.
        Depends on the mounted gripper. Always taken from here (not on the controller).
      read_kinematics_from_device: when True, read l1/l2 and the tool length from
        the controller at setup and use them for kinematics; the constructor's
        ``gripper_length`` then acts only as a fallback. Set False to force the
        constructor values regardless of what the controller reports.
      recover_out_of_range: when True (the default), an out-of-range axis (its current position
        outside its soft limit - a state the controller rejects every commanded move for, -1012) is
        driven back into range once via ``recover_axes_within_limits``, the same way at both moments
        it matters: at setup, and before a commanded move (which then retries). If it is still out
        of range after that, ``OutOfRangeOfMotionError`` propagates (no loop). Set False to forbid
        this autonomous motion - an out-of-range axis then raises instead, carrying recovery
        instructions. Every recovery is logged.
      closed_gripper_position: firmware-unit value (passed to ``GripClosePos`` /
        ``GripOpenPos``) at which the jaws are at the narrow end of
        :attr:`PreciseFlexGripper.jaw_width_range`.
        Depends on the mounted gripper. The conversion mm → firmware units is
        linear with slope 1: ``units = closed_gripper_position + (width_mm -
        jaw_width_range[0])``.
      parking_position: initial value for the public, runtime-settable ``parking_position`` that
        ``park()`` moves to. Leave None (the default) and setup fills the generic default RIGHT pose
        (planar fold, Z column at 3/4 of the discovered travel); reassign it any time to park
        elsewhere. While unset (no configuration), ``park()`` falls back to ``movetosafe``.
      vision_host: address of the PreciseVision engine, a separate machine from the controller (its
        own box with its own IP). Set it to connect to the engine, which powers both image fetch and
        engine-side discovery/introspection (what tool types, tools, processes, and projects exist).
        None leaves the engine unconnected, disabling those; the controller-side execution path
        (running processes/tools, setting properties, lighting, barcodes, stereo locate) is
        unaffected. Only consulted when setup discovers an IntelliGuide vision module.
      workspace: the workspace to reflect the arm into. Optional: without one the driver still
        drives the arm, and models nothing.
      declared_configuration_json: path to a JSON file holding a declared configuration, as
        `save_configuration` writes one. The only way a configuration is read from a file.
        Discovery cross-checks it against what the controller answers.

    No caller is concurrent today (a single async flow drives the arm), so the lock is currently
