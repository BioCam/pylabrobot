In 2022, a split of PerkinElmer resulted in one part, comprising its applied, food and enterprise services businesses, being sold to the private equity firm New Mountain Capital for $2.45 billion and thus no longer being public but keeping the PerkinElmer name. The other part, comprised of the life sciences and diagnostics businesses, remained public but required a new name, which in 2023 was announced as Revvity, Inc.[3] From the perspective of Revvity, the goal of creating a separate company was that its businesses might show greater profit margins and more in the way of growth potential.[1] An associated goal was to have more financial flexibility moving forward.[3] On May 16, 2023, the PerkinElmer stock symbol PKI was replaced by the new symbol RVTY.
